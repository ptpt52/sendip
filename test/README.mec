udptimer - this is a simple test program we've used (in conjunction
with sendip) for testing end-to-end latency. It expects a timestamp at
the beginning of the data, in the format (tN) generated by sendip. It
then records the latency - or, more precisely, the difference between
the timestamp value and the time returned by gettimeofday() - indexed
by the source IP address. Whenever traffic is quiescent for a period
of 10 seconds, it prints out some statistics about the traffic it has
seen so far, again divided by source IP address.

To have this be a decent measure of latency, you'll want to make the
sender and receiver clocks are reasonably well coordinated by, e.g.,
ntp. In practice, we've used this more for measuring deltas in latency -
e.g., what effect some change in the router or competing traffic would
have - rather than an absolute measure.

Suggest: ensure the socket receive buffer is at maximum size:
cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default

Can also do the same for send buffer:
cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default
